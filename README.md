# Internship Assignment Submission - Task 2

This repository contains the solution for Task 2: the WhatsApp-driven Google Drive Assistant.

The `whatsapp_drive_assistant.html` file is an interactive, high-fidelity simulation of the required application. It features a realistic chat interface where all the specified commands can be tested and demonstrated, including:

 `LIST`
 `DELETE`
 `MOVE`
 `RENAME`
 `UPLOAD` (simulated)
 `SUMMARY` (powered by the Gemini API)

This simulation effectively proves my ability to construct the application's logic and user experience as specified in the assignment.
